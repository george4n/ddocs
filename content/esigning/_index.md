# An Introduction to eSigning

Electronic signatures are a legal concept distinct from [digital signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature "Digital signature"), a cryptographic mechanism often used to implement electronic signatures. While an electronic signature can be as simple as a name entered in an electronic document, [digital signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature "Digital signature") are increasingly used in e-commerce and in regulatory filings to implement electronic signatures in a [cryptographically protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") way. Standardization agencies like [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST "NIST") or [ETSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETSI "ETSI") provide standards for their implementation (e.g., [NIST-DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm "Digital Signature Algorithm"), [XAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES "XAdES") or [PAdES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAdES "PAdES")). The concept itself is not new, with common law jurisdictions having recognised [telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph "Telegraph") signatures as far back as the mid-19th century and faxed signatures since the 1980s.
