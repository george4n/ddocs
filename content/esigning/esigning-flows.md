### What is an eSigning Flow?

Think of an **eSigning Flow** as a blueprint for how documents should be sent to your customers. In a flow, you can configure:

* The senders of a document
* The data pushed into the document
* Triggers for how customers interact with a document

Any document sent through a flow will obey the rules above.

The **eSigning Flow** page gives us a complete overview of all document flows. A document flow is a template mechanism for how documents should be created and sent to customers. It shows:

* Flow Title
* Campaign
* Trigger Type (SMS and/or Email)
* Status (Active/Inactive)
* Date Created
* Creator
* E-sign Provider

From this page, we can:

* Create new flows
* Duplicate flows
* Delete flow
* Activate/deactivate flow
