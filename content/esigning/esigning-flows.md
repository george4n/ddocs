### What is an eSigning Flow?

An **eSigning Flow** is a blueprint for how documents should be sent to your customers. In a flow, you can configure:

* The senders of a document - from who the document will be sent from
* The data pushed into the document - you can push data into the document from the ringcard, orderforms, etc
* Triggers for how customers interact with a document - what should happen if a document gets signed, rejected, or expired.

The **eSigning Flow** page gives us a complete overview of all document flows. On this page, we can see the following:

* Flow Title - a name given to the flow
* Campaign - which campaigns will use this flow
* Trigger Type (SMS and/or Email) - you can send via SMS or Email or both!
* Status - whether a flow is active or inactive
* Date Created - when the flow was created
* Creator - who created the flow
* eSigning Provider - which eSigning provider the flow will utilise

From this page, we can:

* Create new flows
* Duplicate flows
* Delete flow
* Activate/deactivate flow - click on the active/inactive status
